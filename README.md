# Yubi

## About

Yubi is a minimlist typing test heavily based on and inspired by (i.e. basically a clone of) [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).
I encourage you to try Yubi and also heartily recommend you try monkeytype for one of the best typing test experiences around!

This is intended to be a full-stack portfolio project using Javascript as the main language, React as the front-end, and Node/Express as the back-end.
I love monkeytype and wanted to attempt a recreation of it while adding some features of my own, especially features I thought would be helpful for learning alternative keyboard layouts (e.g. Dvorak, Colemak-DH, Canary, etc.).

## Features

Yubi has only a few of monkeytype's wonderful features including:

- minimalist design
- feedback on correct, incorrect, extra, and missed characters while typing
- timed and word count test modes
- results such as raw and net words per minute (WPM) and percent accuracy
- smooth caret that emulates the cursor in a text editor

## Roadmap

- more English word groups (1k, 2k, 5k, 10k most common)
- other word groups for fun and variety
- alternative keyboard layout training utilities
  - keyboard layout display
  - most frequent bigram/trigram word groups with configuration for keyboard or finger combinations
- programming practice mode
  - for learning to type numbers and symbols on programmable split ortho or column-staggered keyboards where non-alpha keys are often moved to different layers
- user accounts to save typing test history
- charts/plots of results

## Credits

All credit for the concept and design belongs to [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/).
Most of Yubi is simply my attempt at recreating and reverse-engineering just a few of its many wonderful features.

## Lessons Learned

TBD
